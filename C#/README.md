# C# Coding Standards
Coding conventions serve the following purposes:

- They create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout.

- They enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.

- They facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.

- They demonstrate C# best practices.
