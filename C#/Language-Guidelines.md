# C# Language GuidelinesThe following guidlines have been adapted from the Microsoft C#.NET guidlines. Some of the guidlines are also specific to Code Change.## VariablesUse implicit type var for local variable declarations. Exception: primitive types (int, string, double, etc) use predefined names.```c#var stream = File.Create(path);var customers = new Dictionary();// Exceptionsint index = 100;string timeSheet;bool isCompleted;// Also acceptablevar index = 100;var timeSheet = default(string);var isCompleted = default(bool);```Why: removes clutter, particularly with complex generic types. Type is easily detected with Visual Studio tooltips.Use predefined type names instead of system type names like Int16, Single, UInt64, etc.```c#// Correctstring firstName;int lastIndex;bool isSaved; // AvoidString firstName;Int32 lastIndex;Boolean isSaved;```Why: consistent with the Microsoft's .NET Framework and makes code more natural to read.## ScopeScope defines the "visibility" that portions of a program have.Always define the scope of a declaration (i.e. variable, property, method, enum, interface, class or struct). The default scope is usually public, but always be explicit.```c#// Avoidclass Document{}// Insteadpublic class Document{}```Think about scope carefully. It's not always necessary to make something public; sometimes internal is a better option. Also, consider using protected instead of private if a class might be inherited.## Mutability## Object Construction## Dependency Injection## Inheritance## SOLID PrinciplesTry to adhere to the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) where possible.
