# C# Commenting Conventions- Place the comment on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code.- Begin comment text with an uppercase letter.- End comment text with a period.- Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text, as shown in the following example.```c#// The following declaration creates a query. It does not run the query.```- Do not create formatted blocks of asterisks around comments.- Do not comment every single line of code; just blocks of code that require more explanation.- Document your code with [XML comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/xml-documentation-comments).	- Add XML comment blocks to all interfaces, classes, constructors, methods and properties.	- Add text to each tag, even if it is obvious.	- Use the &lt;remarks&gt; tag where a more detailed explanation is required. When suing this tag and the text becomes very long, add line breaks to make it more readable.```c#/// <summary>/// Defines a contract for a service that manages user accounts/// </summary>public interface IUserAccountManager{    /// <summary>    /// Changes a users password    /// </summary>    /// <param name="accountNumber">The account number</param>    /// <param name="currentPassword">The current password</param>    /// <param name="newPassword">The new password</param>    /// <remarks>    /// The current password is used to authenticate the request, for security reasons.    ///    /// There is no way to know what the current password is; instead it is validated    /// using a hashing algorithm.    ///     /// Any validation on the new password should be done before calling this method.    /// <remarks>    void ChangePassword    (        string accountNumber,        string currentPassword,        string newPassword    );}```
